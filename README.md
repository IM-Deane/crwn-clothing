**Current Version:** 0.0.2

## Description:

**Overview:**

E-commerce site created while learning advanced React concepts.

Although this app was created while following a
[Udemy tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/),
I still plan to document what we are learning.

**Outcome:**

Although I've created larger React projects before, I have not done so using
class-based components.

To really learn React, I believe it is crucial to understand this aspect even
though i'll likely use hooks.

Therefore, besides brushing up on core concepts, the main goal of this project
is to build a large-scale react app with class-based components.

### Stack:

- React
- SASS
- Firebase
- Stripe API (for payments)
