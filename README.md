**Current Version:** 0.0.6

## Description:

**Overview:**

E-commerce site created while learning advanced React concepts.

Although this app was created while following a
[Udemy tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/),
I still plan to document what we are learning.

**Outcome:**

Although I've created larger React projects before, I have not done so using
class-based components.

To really learn React, I believe it is crucial to understand this aspect even
though i'll likely use hooks.

Therefore, besides brushing up on core concepts, the main goal of this project
is to build a large-scale react app with class-based components.

### Stack:

- React
- SASS
- Firebase
- Stripe API (for payments)

## Version History:

**Version 0.0.6:**

Implemented header component to the site. The app now has true routing.

**Version 0.0.5:**

Added a shop page that a user can navigate to.

Once they land on this page, the user is presented with various collections that
the store has for sale.

To implement this, besides the main shop page, we added a collection preview
component which displayed the first four items in the collection.

We also added an individual collection item component which holds the styling
and data for each product.

**Version 0.0.4:**

Implemented basic routing using react-router-dom.

Since we're not using hooks yet, i've learned how to utilzie the withRouter()
component.

This HOC allows us to access the history, location, and match props without
using prop drilling.

**Version 0.0.3:**

Added additional styling to menu items

**Version 0.0.2:**

Refactored Homepage component into several separate components.

This allows each component to focus on its own job.

Also added styling to the section cards

**Version 0.0.1:**

Added the basic site boilerplate and created the homepage layout of the website.
